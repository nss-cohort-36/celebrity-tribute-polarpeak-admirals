                It was once a little known fact that Ringo's entire drumming career with the Beatles was the product of
                an
                altercation with the Beatles original drummer, Pete Best. <br><br> In 1962, the Beatles were setting up
                to play a
                concert
                at a venue owned by Ringo's parents. Competitive in nature, Ringo used his family connection to get back
                stage
                and challenge Pete Best to a "drum off." Unaware that Pete was inebriated on this particular night,
                Ringo
                had
                the bright idea to introduce himself by knocking a drumstick out of Pete's hand. This began a physical
                fight
                in
                which Ringo not only broke Pete's dominant arm, but did so in front of Pete's girlfriend, causing Pete a
                level
                of embarrassment so severe that he quit the band and left town immediately. <br><br> Because the Beatles
                were now
                without
                a drummer for the night, they had no choice but to allow young Ringo a chance to prove his skills and
                fill
                in a
                their drummer for the night. Ringo did so well, he was asked to become the new drummer.

                Ringo was born a lefty, but in the era he grew up in, almost all items were made solely for people with
                a
                dominant right hand. <br><br>Having to adapt to right-handed equipment and instruments is a part of what
                made
                his
                drumming style so unique. His style was so unique, in fact, that Ringo felt he was the real star of the
                band, because it was his contribution that brought energy to the songs.<br><br>
                "Without my drum beat, the ladies don't move thier feet.", declares Ringo between drags of his
                cigarette.

                    The Beatles only won 4 Grammys together before the group broke up.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Best New Artist, 1964</li>
                    <li>Best Performance by a Vocal Group, 1964 (“A Hard Day’s Night”)</li>

                <p>Unfortunately for Ringo, the group commonly played "keep away" and wouldn't allow him to touch the

            <p class="right" id="center"> Ringo Starr was The Beatles' drummer and occasional singer. <br><br>
                He was the oldest member and the last to join the band.<br><br>
                He couldn't read or write music. He played by "feel".<br><br>
                He was the most poplular Beatle when they made their debut in America in 1964.<br><br>
                Simply put...he was the Real Starr.
