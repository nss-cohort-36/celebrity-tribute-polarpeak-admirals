        <p>Ringo Starr was born Richard Starkey on 7 July 1940, at 9 Madryn Street in the Dingle area of Liverpool. The boy's parents split up when he was three years old. His mother Elsie married a man called Harry Graves, whom encouraged the young Ritchie's passion for music.</section></p>

        <p>Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Los Angeles, and Monte Carlo. In 2014, Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst was for sale, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles.</p>

            <p>Ringo and his first wife Maureen Cox were married in 1965 and went on to have three children – Zak, their eldest, Jason and Lee. Ringo has seven grandchildren in total – one from Zak, three from Jason and three from Lee.  

                    He and Maureen divorced in 1975 and Maureen sadly died of leukaemia at the age of 48 in 1994.
                    
                    While on the set of the film Caveman in 1980, Ringo met actress Barbara Bach. The couple married the following year and currently divide their time between London and Los Angeles.

        <p>Ringo Starr and Maureen Starkey welcomed their first son, Zak, after getting married earlier in the year. Although the Beatles drummer discouraged his son from getting involved in the music industry, Zak began taking an interest in the drums after his godfather, Keith Moon, gave him a drum set at the age of eight.<br><br>
                Two years into her marriage to Ringo, Maureen gave birth to a second son, Jason. While growing up, Jason got into more than his share of brushes with the law. He was fined for trying to steal a car stereo when he was 20 and appeared in court on drug charges a couple years later. But Jason put those days behind him, joining a succession of indie bands.<br><br>
                Lee arrived just after the breakup of the Beatles in 1970, and just as her parents’ relationship was falling apart (although Ringo and Maureen wouldn’t divorce for another five years). Lee got some major attention in 1989 when she co-starred in an Oldsmobile ad with her father.

        Ringo was an only child, and while his mother doted on him, his father lost interest in family life early on. His parents split up when Starkey was only four, and he never saw much of his father after that. His mother worked as a cleaning woman and then a barmaid to support them.
